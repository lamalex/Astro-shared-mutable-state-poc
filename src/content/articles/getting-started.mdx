# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern web framework<FootnoteRef id="ABC_123" registry={props.registry} /> that allows you to build fast, content-focused websites. Unlike traditional frameworks, Astro ships zero JavaScript by default, making your sites incredibly fast.

## Key Features

One of Astro's most powerful features is its component islands architecture<FootnoteRef id="DEF_456" registry={props.registry} />. This allows you to use components from different frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte within the same project.

The framework also supports excellent developer experience with features like:

- Hot module replacement
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Built-in optimizations
