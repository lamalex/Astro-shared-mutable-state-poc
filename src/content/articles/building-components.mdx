# Building Reusable Components

Creating reusable components is essential for maintainable web applications. Astro<FootnoteRef id="ABC_123" registry={props.registry} /> provides several patterns for building components that can be shared across your project.

## Astro Components

Astro's native component format combines the power of JSX-like syntax with server-side rendering. Components are rendered at build time, ensuring optimal performance.

## Framework Integration

You can also integrate components from popular frameworks. For example, React components can be hydrated selectively when interactivity is needed.

## Component Props and Slots

Astro supports both props and slots for component composition:

```astro
---
export interface Props {
  title: string;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}
---
```

This flexibility makes it easy to create component libraries that are both powerful and easy to use<FootnoteRef id="GHI_789" registry={props.registry} />. 
The entire development process for this system was demonstrated live<FootnoteRef id="OPENCODE_001" registry={props.registry} />, 
and the source code is available<FootnoteRef id="GITHUB_REPO" registry={props.registry} />.
